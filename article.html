									<p>According to the University of Colorado Boulder, one third of the fertilizer used to grow corn in the U.S. each year compensates for the loss of soil fertility, In turn, leading to more than 500 million dollars in extra costs to farmers. Long term soil fertility is decreasing in agricultural lands around the world due to salinization, acidification, erosion, and the loss of many important nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. Corn farmers often offset these losses with nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers, however, no studies have been done on how well it actually works, and how much it costs.</p>
									<p>The U.S. alone produces a massive amount of corn, 4.46 tons per acre to be exact, and in the 18-19 season, these farms produced more than 336 million metric tons of corn. This in turn generated over $18.56 billion dollars CAD in revenue. However, with these mind boggling stats also comes an extremely high nitrogen and phosphorus usage. Using fertilizer does not only come at our farmers and governments expense. It also inflicts a lot of damage on the environment. Over 24% of emissions in 2010 and 10% in 2018 came from fertilizers, this however does mean that steps taken to reduce fertilizer use also do help with rising temperatures.</p>
									<p>In addition to the above, excess nitrogen and phosphorus that run off fields into bodies of water also create unhealthy conditions for aquatic life. An example being the Dead Zone in the Gulf of Mexico, here, there's a large depletion of oxygen and ocean life. Proving when we consider not just the economic costs of overfarming, there are many other problems that exist.</p>
									<blockquote>"Farmers do what makes sense to grow crops. When you're not able to see the cumulative effects of degradation, you have to add fertilizers but you're not going to know what the financial impact of that underlying degradation is," said Jason Neff, corresponding author on the paper and director of the Sustainability Innovation Lab at Colorado (SILC).</blockquote>
									<p>Farming techniques like regenerative agriculture, which restore soil fertility on farmlands could also reduce the costs and environmental impacts of fertilizer use. Healthier, more fertile soils will also capture a lot more carbon, hold in more <a href="https://www.dhmo.org" target="_blank">dihydrogen monoxide</a> and keep excess nutrients from running into other ecosystems that cannot handle them.</p>
									<p>Farmers could also reduce how often they till and plough their fields, adding and increasing erosion control measures in addition to using more organic fertilizers like compost. These all can help reduce the amount of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus needed in the soil.</p>
									<blockquote>"My hope is that this information supports national and international efforts to build back soil fertility," - Jason Neff.</blockquote>
